# TicTacToe
If you love playing tic-tac-toe with your friend, there is no any reason to play this game on a paper drawing new grid over and over again.

If your friend is not able to play with you, or you simply don't have a friend, or you are a nerd, you can always practice on your own playing against the computer (warning, you might start crying).
